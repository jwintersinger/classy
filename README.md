Classy
======

Classy will query the University of Calgary's PeopleSoft installation to
determine if spots are available in class sections of interest, then e-mail you
as soon as one opens. For more details, please see [my blog post introducing
Classy][blog post].

To use, do the following:

    cp config.py.example config.py
    # Now edit config.py as you please.
    ./classy.py
